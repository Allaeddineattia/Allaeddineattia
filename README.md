### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alla Eddine ATTIA and I was born in September 23, 1996.
For now I'm a software Engineer Student and I really like software development. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my graduation project within Smart global advertisement company. I'm building a system capable of managing and displaying ads on a network of embedded systems. I'm using C++, Spring boot and Angular.

- ðŸ˜„ I love the free software community and I was the general secretary of The Free Software Club of the Faculty of Science of Tunis.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS and I'm eager to start learning Rust.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love video games and Pink floyd. If you're a big fan of pink floyd, then we can be friends.
